Special Thanks to our Lead and Associate Instructors for the Javascript course
Mr. Nicholas Altunian, Mr. John Margotti and Ms. Megha Zavar
I have learned, struggled alot and blew my brains out. I had to pick it up off the floor and put it back in my head thanks to you guys.
With all that said, I am grateful and appreciate the time and effort our instructors gave us to teach and help us go through this wonderful journey of learning Javascript.
Thank you very much!
