Special Thanks to our Lead and Associate Instructors for the Javascript course <br>
Mr. Nicholas Altunian, Mr. John Margotti and Ms. Megha Zavar <br>
I have learned, struggled alot and blew my brains out. I had to pick it up off the floor and put it back in my head thanks to you guys. <br>
With all that said, I am grateful and appreciate the time and effort our instructors gave us to teach and help us go through this wonderful journey of learning Javascript. <br>
Thank you very much! <br>
